## Running Solution ##
On a refresh clone of the repository, Nuget only downloads the dependencies to the packages directory.
To get the client files to "unpack" to the project directory you will need to open Nuget console and run `Update-Package -reinstall`.
The install script of the package is what actually places the files into the project.
